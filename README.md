#top-Library

## About this Project

This project was constructed [as part of The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). It's a small Library app that takes a user's input to store book objects into an array and manage them with simple functionalities like adding and removing books and toggling a book's read status. 

The main focus of this assignment was to ensure the application of basic JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation to create a dynamic user experience without the need for any backend server or storage system.

## Learning outcomes
- Developing a foundational understanding of JavaScript objects and arrays.
- Gaining familiarity with DOM manipulation to reflect data changes.
- Implementing event handling and event prevention in forms.
- Structuring the project in a modular fashion.

## Assignment requirements: 

The Odin Project provided an outline of [the Library assignment with requirements in their JavaScript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). Emphasis was laid on using plain JavaScript to achieve these functionalities without relying on any libraries or frameworks. This ensured a deep understanding of core JavaScript principles. At this time, there was no requirement for any type of storage, as we'll hook it up to a database later in the curriculum. 

### The Objective:
1. Set up a project with a basic HTML/CSS/JS structure.
2. Store book objects in a simple array.
3. Use an object constructor
4. Display each book in a structured format, like a table or card.
5. Allow users to add new books via a form.
6. Provide options to remove a book or change its read status dynamically.
