#top-Library

## About this Project

This project was constructed [as part of The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). It's a small Library app that takes a user's input to store book objects into an array and manage them with simple functionalities like adding and removing books and toggling a book's read status. 

The primary goal of this assignment was to use basic JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation without relying on any libraries or frameworks to meet the requirements and functionality outlined in the [project description](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

## Learning outcomes
- Developing a foundational understanding of JavaScript objects and arrays.
- Gaining familiarity with DOM manipulation to reflect data changes.
- Implementing event handling and event prevention in forms.
- Structuring the project in a modular fashion.

## Assignment requirements: 

The Odin Project provided an outline of [the Library assignment with requirements in their JavaScript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). 

### The Objective:
1. Set up a project with a basic HTML/CSS/JS structure.
2. Store book objects in a simple array.
3. Use an object constructor
4. Display each book in a structured format, like a table or card.
5. Allow users to add new books via a form.
6. Provide options to remove a book or change its read status dynamically.

At this time, there was no requirement for any type of storage, as we'll hook it up to a database later in the curriculum.
